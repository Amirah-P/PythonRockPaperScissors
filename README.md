<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: Randomisation and Python lists</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Project was created using randomisation and python lists. The user is prompted to choose 1 ,2 or 3 When the rn button is the computer will randomly choose a... This project is written in Python and introduces beginners to basic concepts such as lists, conditional logic, and user input. The program begins by prompting the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors using a number-based input. It then stores the three possible hand signs as strings or ASCII art inside a list, allowing the program to access the corresponding choice by index. The computer’s choice is generated using the random module, selecting a number from 0 to 2.

After displaying both the user’s and computer’s choices, the program uses a series of if/elif/else statements to compare outcomes and determine whether the user wins, loses, or ties. The project reinforces Python fundamentals like indexing, importing modules, and implementing decision-making logic while creating a simple, interactive game.
